# 📁 File Loading on Streamlit Cloud - Important Info

## ✅ Yes, It Will Load Files Correctly!

Your Material Planning Assistant has been updated with **improved file loading** that works on both:
- 💻 Local deployment (your computer)
- ☁️ Streamlit Cloud (GitHub deployment)

---

## 🔍 How File Loading Works

### **Option 1: Auto-Detection (Recommended for Streamlit Cloud)**
When you upload your Excel file to GitHub, the app will:
1. Search for files matching: `MV_Material_Study-*.xlsx`
2. If found, automatically load it
3. Show "📄 Auto-detected: [filename]" in the sidebar
4. You can uncheck and upload a different file if needed

### **Option 2: Manual Upload (Fallback)**
If no file is auto-detected:
1. The app will show a file uploader in the sidebar
2. Users can upload their Excel file directly through the browser
3. This works great for testing with different files

## 📋 Deployment Instructions for File Loading

### **Step 1: Name Your Excel File Correctly**
For auto-detection to work, name your file:
- ✅ `MV_Material_Study-2024.xlsx`
- ✅ `MV_Material_Study-October.xlsx`
- ✅ `MV_Material_Study-v1.xlsx`
- ❌ `my_data.xlsx` (won't auto-detect, but can still be uploaded manually)

### **Step 2: Upload to GitHub Root Directory**
Place your Excel file in the **same folder** as `material_planning_assistant.py`:

```
your-repository/
├── material_planning_assistant.py
├── requirements.txt
├── MV_Material_Study-2024.xlsx  ← Put your file here!
└── README.md
```

### **Step 3: Deploy**
When you deploy to Streamlit Cloud:
- The app will find and load your Excel file automatically
- Users will see: "📄 Auto-detected: MV_Material_Study-2024.xlsx"
- Everything will work seamlessly!

## 🔧 What's Been Improved

### **Better Error Handling**
- If the expected file pattern isn't found, the app now:
  - Searches for any Excel file with "Material" or "Study" in the name
  - Shows available Excel files for debugging
  - Provides clear upload instructions

### **Helpful Debugging**
- Shows which files are available in the directory
- Provides clear error messages if something goes wrong
- Guides users on what to do next

### **Flexible Loading**
- Works with files in the repository (for cloud deployment)
- Allows manual upload (for testing or different files)
- Caches data for better performance

## 🎯 Quick Answer to Your Question

**Q: Will it load the file correctly on GitHub?**

**A: YES! ✅**

As long as you:
1. ✅ Name your file starting with `MV_Material_Study-`
2. ✅ Upload it to the GitHub repository root folder
3. ✅ Make sure it has a "Study" sheet inside

The app will automatically detect and load it when deployed on Streamlit Cloud!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "No Material Study file found"
**Solution**: 
- Check your file is named `MV_Material_Study-*.xlsx`
- Verify it's in the root directory (same folder as the .py file)
- Try uploading manually using the file uploader

### "Failed to load data"
**Solution**:
- Ensure your Excel file has a sheet named "Study"
- Check that all required columns exist
- Try opening the file locally to verify it's not corrupted

### File shows but won't load
**Solution**:
- The "Study" sheet might be missing or misnamed
- Check column names match expected format
- Review the error message for specific details

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep a backup**: Always keep your Excel file in your GitHub repository
2. **Version control**: Name files with dates (e.g., `MV_Material_Study-2024-10-28.xlsx`)
3. **Test locally first**: Run the app on your computer before deploying
4. **Use the uploader**: If auto-detection fails, the manual uploader always works

## ✅ You're All Set!

The updated code now has **robust file loading** that will work perfectly on Streamlit Cloud. Just follow the deployment steps and your app will load the data automatically! 🚀
